# walgit — architecture and operating manual for contributors (humans and agents)

Context: **everyone, first.** Read this before touching the repository: the constraints the design answers
(§1), how the WAL works (§2), the principles a PR is judged against (§3), every design decision in force (§4),
and the working rules (§5). Reading order starts at `GOAL.md`; §0 maps every other document.

> **No backwards compatibility (pre-1.0).** We owe nothing to previous shapes of this system. Do not keep
> aliases, fallbacks, shims, deprecated routes, old config keys, old proto fields or migration code. When a
> decision changes the shape, **delete the old shape in the same change**: routes, clients, tests, docs, config
> keys. Data in the bucket is the one exception — WAL/manifest/log formats stay append-only and replayable,
> because the bucket is the repository; everything else is disposable. If you find yourself writing "still
> accepted for …" or "legacy", stop and remove the thing instead.

walgit serves git over smart HTTP (v0/v2), receive-pack, upload-pack, bundle-uri, LFS and a browsing web UI,
written in Rust, from disposable hosts whose only durable state is an object-store bucket. The reference workload
it was built against is a 57 GiB / 73 M-object / 1.4 M-commit / 466 k-ref monorepo with LFS, served from
machines whose "disk" is 20 GiB of tmpfs, next to a long tail of small repositories. The design follows Cursor's
*Git at any scale* (Continuity); `README.md` tells the story, this file keeps the rules.

## 0. Document map (one home per fact — link, don't duplicate)

| Doc | Who / when to read it |
|---|---|
| `GOAL.md` | Everyone, first. What walgit is for, the acceptance table, what we do not optimise for. |
| `AGENTS.md` (this) | Everyone. Constraints §1, WAL §2, principles §3, decisions §4, working rules §5. |
| `README.md` | The introduction: why (the Cursor lineage), what it does, how it works briefly, running it, invariants. |
| `docs/BUNDLE_URI_DESIGN.md` | Anyone touching bundles, the scheduler, base rebuilds, or big-repo clone/fetch UX. Design of record; normative config in §4. |
| `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md` | **Anyone touching a protocol that talks to the bucket** (publish, sync, checkpoints, compaction/leases, bundles, remote reader, store backends). Round trips are the cost model; correct is not sufficient. |
| `docs/POLICY.md` | Anyone touching receive-pack authorization or writing a repo policy. Normative rule language. |
| `docs/LFS.md` | Anyone touching LFS (`lfs.rs`, `lfs_upstream.rs`) or importing a repository whose LFS history lives elsewhere. |

| `docs/EVENTS.md` | Anyone changing WAL-derived ref events, the webhook bridge, consumer semantics or event cursors. |
| `docs/CONTRACT.md` | When you touch a crate boundary. The cross-crate contract; *extend, don't rename*; code wins where they differ. |

## 1. Constraints we design for

### 1.1 The machine: small, ephemeral, shared-nothing
- Assume an instance of **a few vCPU and tens of GiB of memory where the disk *is* that memory** (tmpfs).
  `cache.max_bytes` (default 20 GiB) is the budget for everything on disk. A monorepo's base pack alone can be
  30+ GB: **it cannot be materialized there, ever.** A host with a real SSD (`cache.mode = "disk"`) is the
  exception, placed by configuration, not the rule.
- **Instances are ephemeral and shared-nothing**: no stable identity, no node-to-node networking, no gossip.
  Explicit placement (D30) decides which hosts perform a repository's object work; refs-level reads remain
  available everywhere, including during a deploy.
- **CPU may be throttled between requests** on serverless platforms; background work there must be bounded
  (`wal.prefetch_max_bytes`).
- **Object store facts**: ~60–80 ms per GET, ~100 MB/s per connection (stripe for more), conditional GET ~15 ms;
  same-object overwrite is serialized (~1 write/s) — a single CAS'd object is a throughput cap.
- Operations that need real disk or hours of CPU (a full `repack -adb` of a monorepo, building its 30 GB weekly
  bundle) run on a host with an SSD using the same binary and the same WAL/lease protocol (`walgit compact
  --base`, `walgit import`, the `maintain` role with `maintenance.disk = "ssd"`).

### 1.2 What follows
- **Never fully materialize a big repo on a small instance.** Serve from the parts that fit: refs from the WAL
  (ref snapshot + log tail), pack *indexes* + bitmaps + commit-graph locally, pack *data* by range read from the
  bucket (remote reader) or a read-only bucket mount, recent small packs locally. Clone bytes come from static
  bundles, never through upload-pack.
- **An instance must become useful in seconds**, cold: refs in < 1 s (one manifest GET + snapshot + tail),
  objects for the web UI within the first request (remote reader), fetch remainders from local small packs.
- **Everything an instance computes that is immutable is cached for everyone**: in-process LRU and, where a
  second instance would otherwise recompute, the bucket itself (`cache/api/v1/*.json`). Wiping every instance
  loses nothing but warmth.
- **No silent waiting.** Long work is a *task* (id, log, lock, attachable stream) and is narrated to the
  client: SSE envelope for the web UI, sideband band-2 lines for git. "Cloning into… and then nothing" is a bug.

### 1.3 Security contract (`Config::validate` fails closed)
- Three auth modes (`server.auth.mode`): **`none`** (everyone is `anon` with write and admin — `validate` refuses unless `server.listen` is loopback),
  **`token`** (static tokens from the config, as `Authorization: Bearer` or an HTTP Basic password), **`oidc`**
  (any OpenID Connect issuer via discovery). In `oidc` mode `anonymous_read` must be false and an allowlist
  (`allowed_domains`/`allowed_emails`) must exist; three credentials are accepted — an ID token from the issuer
  (RS256/ES256, `iss`, `exp`, `aud` ∈ `audiences` ∪ {`oauth_client_id`}, `email_verified`), a **walgit access
  token** (`wgt_…`, HMAC-signed with `session_secret`, minted at `/_auth/tokens` by a signed-in browser, stateless,
  `access_token_ttl`; rotating the secret revokes all), and the HMAC **session cookie** set by `/_auth/login` →
  issuer → `/_auth/callback`. Static `tokens` work in `oidc` mode too (robots). Every path ends in the same
  allowlist and `write_domains`.
- Open at the application (no credential): `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/repos.js`, `/repos.mjs`, `/_auth/*` (the
  sign-in flow itself) and **`/services/public/*`** (data-free; today `install.sh` + `ca.pem`; everything else
  under it 404; never reads repo data or takes a bearer — test `public_lane_serves_only_the_installer_without_auth`).
- **The server answers an invalid/expired credential with a real 401** — that is what makes git `erase` it from
  its helpers and ask again; the friendly 200 + in-band ERR is reserved for failures a retry cannot fix (account
  not allowed, verifier down). A 200 leaves git re-storing a dead token for its cache's lifetime.
- **An edge announces what it took over, per request, in `X-Walgit-Capabilities`** (D39): `client-authorization`
  (the client's bearer travels in `X-Walgit-Authorization`; `Authorization` is the hop's own credential and is
  never read as the client's) and `accel-redirect` (static bytes by `X-Accel-Redirect`, honoured only when
  `server.accel_redirect = true` **and the TCP peer is loopback**). Hit directly, nothing is assumed.
- **The installer** (`crates/walgit-server/src/setup.rs`, POSIX sh, idempotent): git ≥ 2.46 + curl; pins a
  self-signed host's CA; takes the token from `$WALGIT_TOKEN`, an already stored one, or the terminal (no terminal:
  exit 2 with the two things to do); writes `~/.config/git/<host>-token` (0600) and the credential helper
  `<host>-credential-helper` (`get` → `authtype=Bearer`; `store` keeps what git hands it; `erase` on a 401 deletes
  the token and names `/_auth/tokens`); sets exactly `credential.https://<host>.helper` = `""` then ours,
  `transfer.bundleURI true`, `fetch.uriProtocols https`; unsets stale `fetch.bundleURI`/`extraHeader`; self-tests
  (`/api/v1/me`, or `ls-remote` of `?repo=`). Recipes come from one place (`setup::Recipes`,
  `/services/setup.json`); the Clone menu, API page, overview and git error help render them.
- **Bundle lists, two of them (D41)**: `bundles/list` is the *clone* list (fulls + chain; advertised in v2);
  **`bundles/catchup`** is the same list without the fulls and is what every recipe records in `fetch.bundleURI`
  — git's creationToken walk would otherwise download every full newer than the client's token.
  Blobless: `…/list?filter=blob:none` / `…/catchup?filter=blob:none`.
- **Host to host**: a front that forwards pushes to a broker presents `wal.push_broker_token` (or
  `WALGIT_BROKER_TOKEN`); the broker lists it in `tokens` and its principal in `trusted_forwarders`, so the end
  user travels in `X-Walgit-Principal`.
- Tests never write the user's global git config (private `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, `tests/lib-auth.sh`).

### 1.4 Requirements (the bar)
- Full git surface: smart HTTP v0/v2, ls-refs with prefixes, fetch with filter/shallow/deepen/sideband-all,
  receive-pack (atomic, delete, tags, push options, report-status-v2), bundle-uri (v2 command + static list),
  LFS batch/basic transfer, `<owner>/<repo>` namespaces. Every read on every instance is as fresh as a fetch:
  push acknowledged ⇒ the next request anywhere sees it.
- Cost must not scale with ref count on any hot path (O(1) `refs`, O(k) `resolve`, paged ref lists, prefix
  filtered advertisements) nor with pack size on a too-small instance.
- Clones of big repos are **static**: the server hands out URLs, the bucket/CDN moves the bytes. `bundles.require`
  rejects clones that skip bundle-uri, with the exact fix in the error text.
- Acceptance for the monorepo: cold instance serves `info/refs`/ls-refs/web `refs` in < 1 s; web UI renders
  main's tree/blob/commits without packs on disk; `git clone` (bundle-uri) + `git fetch` work against a tmpfs
  host; `clone --filter=blob:none --depth=1 --sparse --single-branch` in seconds (reference: 2075 s → 8 s).
  Bounded/CI clones must pass `-c transfer.bundleURI=false`: git downloads the advertised full bundle first
  otherwise (the server cannot see the filter at bundle-uri time).

## 2. The WAL — source of truth, and how we squeeze value out of it

### 2.1 Objects and the commit point (`repos/<owner>/<repo>/…`)
| Object | Role |
|---|---|
| `manifest.pb` | Tiny, **CAS-rewritten**: `head_seq`, live pack set `PackRef[]` (checksum, sizes, tier, has_rev/bitmap), log segments, checkpoint pointer, settings inline, `revision`, `updated_at`. **The linearization point.** Nothing is visible before its CAS; everything after is idempotent and replayable. |
| `log/<first_seq>.pb` | Immutable, uvarint-framed `LogEntry` frames: PUSH / REF_UPDATE (ref transaction + pack pointer), COMPACT (new pack, `supersedes[]`), CHECKPOINT, SETTINGS. Strictly increasing `seq`. One small object per publish batch. |
| `wal/<checksum>.pack/.idx/.rev/.bitmap/.commit-graph` | Immutable packs, content-addressed by pack checksum: push packs (tier 0), compaction outputs (tier 1), the base (tier 2, bitmap'd), plus the side-files a reader needs. |
| `checkpoints/<seq>/checkpoint.pb`, `refs.pb` | Folded state at `seq`: live pack set + full `RefSnapshot`. Cold start = snapshot + tail, never full replay. |
| `bundles/list.pb`, `bundles/<strategy>/…` | bundle-uri artefacts + CAS'd list. |
| `leases/<name>.pb` | CAS lease with TTL heartbeat: `compact`, `bundle:<strategy>`. The only cross-instance mutex. |
| `cache/api/v1/<sha1>.json` | Shared render cache of immutable web API answers. |
| `policy.json` | Per-repo push policy (rule language, not on the WAL). `docs/POLICY.md`. Missing = allow-all. |
| `fsck.pb` | Last connectivity audit (`FsckReport`), written by the maintainer's `fsck` unit, consumed by `repair` (`docs/INTEGRITY.md`). |
| `events/cursor.json` | Durable acknowledged WAL sequence of the events bridge; advanced only after the webhook acknowledged (D32). |
| `lfs/objects/<aa>/<bb>/<oid>` | LFS objects (sha256-addressed, immutable). Missing ones can be read through from `upstream.lfs` and persisted (`docs/LFS.md`). |
Schema `crates/walgit-proto/proto/walgit/v1/wal.proto`; GCS, S3, Azure Blob and in-memory stores share one
contract suite (`crates/walgit-store/tests/contract.rs`, incl. compose).

### 2.2 Write path
receive-pack (ours, `walgit-git/src/receive.rs`) → index the pack locally (`git index-pack --stdin --fix-thin
--keep --rev-index --threads=0`, `--fsck-objects` when `wal.fsck_objects`) in a per-ingest scratch git dir (a
rejected push leaves nothing behind) → connectivity per config (`spawn_blocking`) → **push policy**
(`docs/POLICY.md`) → `pack PUT ∥ idx PUT ∥ log PUT` → **manifest CAS** (group commit per repo per instance,
`wal.batch_window`) → commit local ref txn → `ok` to the client. On 412: refetch, re-validate every old value
(moved ref ⇒ `ng`), re-seq, retry with jittered backoff. **Who writes (D28): the host that maintains a repo.**
Hosts that maintain nothing may forward receive-pack to a **push broker** (`wal.push_broker_url`) so one warm
writer batches the CAS; fallback to the local path if the broker is down. Publish is CAS-safe, so disjoint writer
sets are correct by construction; the broker is an optimization, never a dependency. Never ACK before the bucket
ACKs. **Upstream follow** (`walgit_server::follow`, D33) is the second writer shape: refs in a repo's `[upstream]
follow` are brought up to `upstream.git`'s by the maintaining host every `maintenance.follow_interval` through the
same ingest → connectivity → fast-forward → `publish_push` path, `principal = upstream`.

### 2.3 Read path — sync levels (`RepoHandle::sync_*`, `walgit-wal/src/handle.rs`, `sync.rs`)
Every request: conditional GET of `manifest.pb` (skippable for `wal.freshness_ttl`) → 304 serve / 200 apply.
| Level | Brings | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| **Refs** | checkpoint `RefSnapshot` + every log entry's ref txn → `packed-refs`. No packs. | `info/refs`, `ls-refs`, `bundle-uri`, web `refs`/`resolve`/overview, read_log |
| **Serve** (`sync()`) | Refs + the pack set as the instance can hold it: tiers < 2 and the **history pack** (D18) local; a tier-2 base as side-files (idx/rev/bitmap/commit-graph layer) + `pack-<sha>.pack` linked into a read-only bucket mount (`cache.store_mount`) or **remote-served** without one; midx over history + base | upload-pack, receive-pack, bundle builds, prewarm |
| **Full** (`sync_full()`) | Refs + every live pack local (striped parallel range downloads); only for repos that fit | base rebuilds (`compact --base`), geometric compaction |
| **Objects** | Serve when the pack set fits `cache.max_bytes`, else Refs + **remote reader** → `ObjectAccess::{Local,Remote}` | web API object endpoints |
Long syncs register as tasks (`materialize`, `remote-index`) and stream progress; pack work runs on the **bulk
runtime** and never takes the refs phase's lock (D19). `check_fits` refuses to pull a pack set that cannot fit
(TooLarge → 503 / pkt ERR with the bundle-uri fix). Local disk is a bounded LRU (`cache.max_bytes`,
`evict_idle_after`) in budget mode, watermark eviction in disk mode (D25).

### 2.4 Getting the most out of the WAL (the strategies)
- **Refs-first everything.** Ref advertisement, peeled tags (`RefUpdate.new_peeled` recorded by the writer so
  replicas advertise `^{}` without objects), web `refs`/`resolve` — all from snapshot + tail, no objects.
- **Remote-served bases + gix fetch engine**: at Serve level with no store mount and a pack set that does not fit,
  tier-2 bases are remote-served (`PackPlan::Remote`: commit-graph layer local, nothing else); `git fetch` then
  runs the gix engine (`upload_gix.rs`): commit-graph walk, tree diff, base objects faulted by range, streamed.
- **Remote reader for too-large repos** (`walgit-wal/src/remote.rs`): pack indexes local, data by 1 MiB range
  reads through a process-wide block LRU (`cache.remote_block_bytes`), incremental inflate, iterative delta
  resolution with a decoded-object LRU. The web API faults exactly the objects a git command will touch into the
  loose store (`web/objects.rs`) and runs unchanged `git` renderers. The same contract test runs with a 1-byte cache.
- **Side-files published with packs**: `.idx`, `.rev`, `.bitmap`, and for tier-2 bases a **split commit-graph
  layer** readers install as their chain base. Every pack writer produces `.rev` (`pack.writeReverseIndex`; git
  ≥ 2.47 on the server); a published pack ≥ 250 k objects without one gets it from the maintainer (`rev-index`
  unit) — without it git rebuilds the reverse index in memory on every `pack-objects` (2.85 s per fetch on a
  60 M-object repository).
- **Checkpoints fold the log** when `wal.snapshot_every_entries` OR `wal.checkpoint_interval` OR
  `wal.checkpoint_tail_bytes` fires — the checkpoint is the unit of serving state. Writing one is refs-level work,
  so each `maintain` host checkpoints its own repositories.
- **Provenance for free**: every push and repack is a log entry; `walgit wal ls|show|materialize --at-seq`.
- **Never LIST on a hot path**; 404s are free; probe, don't list. Immutable objects get
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` + strong ETag + Range everywhere (D10 static contract).

### 2.5 Compaction (WAL + git), leader by lease
- Assigned maintainers run **geometric** folding of fresh packs (tier 0 → tier 1, `git repack -d --geometric
  --write-midx`) under `leases/compact.pb`; the result is a COMPACT entry; followers download the new pack and
  drop superseded ones after in-flight readers finish. Triggers: `compaction.trigger_packs`, `trigger_bytes` —
  and at least **two** fresh packs (one pack folds into itself).
- **The base (tier 2, one pack + bitmap) is rebuilt only when the weekly bundle is built, and only on an ssd
  host** — the maintainer's `BaseRebuild` unit, followed by the weekly slot's compose
  (`docs/BUNDLE_URI_DESIGN.md §5`; `walgit compact --base` is the manual form). The rebuild runs in a scratch copy
  under `<cache.dir>/_rebuild/` that survives the process and resumes after a restart iff the WAL head has not
  moved (§5a); the serving copy is never rewritten. Invariant that makes serving cheap: *everything newer than the
  base lives in small/medium packs that fit on every instance.*
- **A fold never touches the base or a history pack** (`--keep-pack`), **a base is rebuilt only by the weekly
  unit / `compact --base`**, and **a rebuild supersedes every other live pack** by the manifest, not by what git
  happened to delete.
- Superseded packs are retained `compaction.retention_superseded` (provenance window) then GC'd.

### 2.5b Self-healing by construction (D22)
Everything the maintainer produces — checkpoints, bundles per slot, compactions, retention — is a **pure function
of (config, WAL state)**. The maintainer does not run schedules; it computes the *desired state* every pass and
performs **one bounded unit of the most important missing work** (checkpoint → repair → missing weekly → missing
dailies oldest-first → missing hourlies → compaction → rev-index → fsck audit), as a task, under a lease. An outage
of any length leaves no permanent hole; a deleted or corrupt artefact is "missing" and rebuilt identically; config
changes take effect by re-planning; there are no one-off backfill scripts.

### 2.6 Bundles (bundle-uri): move clone bytes to static files — **the north star** (`docs/BUNDLE_URI_DESIGN.md`)
- Strategies (config, D21/D22): **weekly full** (for a big repo = base pack ∘ header via store-side compose — GCS
  natively, S3 by multipart `UploadPartCopy`; no disk, no index-pack), **daily incremental** chained on the previous
  daily, **hourly incremental** on the newest daily, each on a calendar slot (6-field UTC cron `schedule`; the fire
  time is the as-of instant), `creationToken = slot epoch`, main-only refs for `bundles.main_only` repos;
  `bundles/list.pb` CAS'd.
- Served as static objects (`/{o}/{r}.git/bundles/...`, ETag/Range, immutable) by walgit or offloaded to an edge
  (`X-Accel-Redirect`, `deploy/nginx.conf.example`), or as presigned store URLs (`serve_via = "signed_url"`);
  advertised in the v2 capability list, at `bundles/list` and on band 2 of every narrated fetch. `bundles.require`
  refuses *unbounded* zero-have fetches of listed repos with the exact fix (D17).
- Builds run on the **maintainer** under `leases/bundle:<strategy>` (Serve sync first; unresolvable tips skipped
  with a notice); weekly full is a compose.
- **Blobless family** (design §6b): strategies with `filter = "blob:none"` — weekly-history = header ∘ the D18
  history pack, incrementals `--filter=blob:none` — advertised ONLY at `bundles/list?filter=blob:none`.

### 2.7 Tasks, progress, narration (`walgit-wal/src/tasks.rs`, `crates/walgit-server/src/sse.rs`, `smart.rs`)
Any long work = a task: unique id, per-instance log (`GET …/tasks`), `(repo, kind)` lock (a second start joins),
replayable packet stream (`GET …/tasks/{id}`). Packets: `notice`, `progress {label,done,total?,unit,percent?}`,
`task`, terminal `result` | `error`. Web: any JSON endpoint that cannot answer immediately streams the SSE
envelope when the client accepts `text/event-stream`; fast answers stay plain cacheable JSON. Git: v2 `fetch`
advertises `sideband-all` and narrates on band 2 (`remote: * …`). Startup: `cache.prewarm` repos run a `prewarm`
task; `/readyz` is 503 until done or `prewarm_ready_timeout`. `no-progress` is honoured.

## 3. Principles (what a PR is judged against)

One idea: **the bucket is the repository; everything else is a cache or a reader of the log.** Ten consequences.
A change that feels natural on a conventional git host (a table, a queue, a cache server, a webhook from the push
path, a bigger disk) is usually a violation here. A violation means the principle is wrong — amend it with a
decision in §4 — or the PR is; never "fix later".

| # | Principle | The tell in a PR | The question to answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **I** | **No state outside the object store.** Disk and memory are caches. | A database, Redis, SQLite, a file that must survive a restart, an env var that encodes data. | "If every instance is wiped now, what is lost?" — must be "warmth". |
| **II** | **The manifest CAS is the only commit point.** Immutable objects are never overwritten (`PutMode::Overwrite` only on the manifest, bundle list, leases, fsck.pb, events/cursor, maintainer heartbeats, render cache). | A second "commit" (a flag file, a list update that makes data visible), an ACK before the bucket's. | "What does a client on another instance see between the PUT and the CAS?" — nothing new. |
| **III** | **Side effects are readers of the WAL, never steps of a write.** Events, mirrors, notifications tail the log from a durable cursor. | A webhook/HTTP call from `receive.rs`, `publish.rs`, `follow.rs`, `smart.rs`. | "If this side effect fails, does the push?" — no. "Is it replayable from the cursor?" — yes. |
| **IV** | **Every read revalidates; there is no eventually.** | A cache that outlives the manifest's generation, a TTL invented for a repo-scoped answer, a read that skips `sync_*`. | "After `push` returns `ok`, can any instance serve the old state?" (`cargo test -p walgit-server --test sim`). |
| **V** | **Serve from the parts that fit; never a bigger box, never a hard-coded host.** | "Just download the pack", a path that assumes the full pack set is local, a hostname in `crates/` or `web/`. | "What happens to this code on a 20 GiB tmpfs with a 32 GB base pack? Which sync level does it need?" |
| **VI** | **Never block the async runtime; bulk bytes never share a lane with the control plane.** | `Command::new(...).output()` or `std::fs` big reads in an `async fn` outside `spawn_blocking`/the bulk runtime; a queued writer on `RepoHandle::rw` from an install path. | "On which thread does this run, and what holds `sync_mutex`/`rw` while it does?" (e2e `blocking_work_in_the_install_path_does_not_stall_requests`). |
| **VII** | **No LIST on a hot path; count the round trips.** | A `.list(` in request handling; a new GET "just to check"; a protocol change without a `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md` row. | Before/after depth in the commit; the sim asserts request budgets (`FaultStore::stats().ops`). |
| **VIII** | **Standalone first; the edge announces, the app never assumes.** | Reading an `X-Walgit-*` request header without checking `X-Walgit-Capabilities`; a feature only testable behind nginx. | "Does this work on `walgit.standalone.toml` with nothing in front?" |
| **IX** | **No silent waiting.** | A new op that blocks a handler, a loop without a task, a `sleep` a client would wait on. | "Where does the client see this taking time?" — a task kind, a progress packet or a band-2 line. |
| **X** | **Keep walgit small.** Upstream `git` does git things; gix only where measured faster and correct; one config file, one auth story, one SDK; scope is `GOAL.md §4`. Proto append-only. | A new dependency without a why; a reimplementation of something `git` does; an alias/shim/"legacy" branch; a removed proto field. | "Which line of GOAL §4 is this for?" |

---

## 4. Decisions in force (append, never silently change)
- **D1** Rust, tokio + axum, HTTP/2 (h2c or ALPN), streaming both ways, gzip request bodies.
- **D2** gix in-process where it is correct and measured; upstream `git` for delta-compressing repack/bitmaps,
  bundle creation, and normal upload-pack. **`git.upload_pack_engine = "auto"` selects stock git wherever it can
  read the packs** (local copies or mount-linked bases); gix handles only a remote-served base. **The gix engine
  never emits thin packs** (`upload_gix.rs`): gix-pack's thin-pack path builds the base pack's whole (offset → oid)
  table per chunk per thread (60 M entries × 44 threads ⇒ 178 GB RSS) and is the only place gix writes an object id
  into a pack (a mid-pack refresh once paired offsets with another pack's table ⇒ a wrong id). The gix pack source
  is a frozen snapshot (`frozen_pack_source`). Reproducer: `walgit-git/tests/upload_gix_scale.rs`.
- **D3** `ObjectStore` trait with CAS version tokens, conditional GET, range, compose; gcs/s3/memory backends.
  `compose` is native on GCS and a multipart `UploadPartCopy` on S3 (`compose_is_native` tells callers which);
  `accel_target` gives an edge a URL (+ bearer on GCS, presigned on S3) to fetch an object itself.
- **D4** protobuf on the wire and in the bucket; schema versioned, append-only.
- **D5** Repo identity `<owner>/<repo>[.git]`, prefix `repos/<o>/<r>/`, creation = CAS create of the manifest.
- **D6** Manifest CAS is the only commit point. **D7** No node identity, no elections; leases for exclusivity.
- **D8** `walgit.toml` only (+ `WALGIT__` env overrides). **D9** One binary, roles by config (`serve`,
  `maintain`, `events`; `maintain` includes compaction and bundles).
- **D10** One static-serving code path for every immutable byte (ETag/304/If-Range/Range/416/HEAD/immutable;
  UI assets precompressed at build; store objects never compressed at request time).
- **D11** Too-large repos are served, not refused: remote reader for the web API; clones via bundle-uri; refs from
  the WAL. Object work returns 503 when remote objects are disabled or the repository is excluded from this host's
  serving placement (D30).
- **D12** Auth is `none` | `token` | `oidc` (§1.3). `oidc` is generic OpenID Connect through discovery; the
  walgit-issued access token (`wgt_…`, HMAC, stateless, `/_auth/tokens`) is the credential git uses, so no client
  needs a vendor CLI to mint tokens. An edge that wants to do auth itself uses `auth_request /_auth/check`
  (`deploy/nginx.conf.example`).
- **D13** Long work is a task and is narrated (§2.7); no endpoint may block silently.
- **D14** Web toolchain: pnpm + Vite only. The build fails unless the optimized SPA artefacts are present.
- **D15** Repo-scoped API lives at `/{o}/{r}/api/…` (refs, resolve, tree, blob, commits, commit, overview, ops,
  tasks, policy, settings) so the repository prefix determines placement. The browser lane is
  `/{o}/{r}/api-browser/…`; `/api/v1` is non-repository discovery, identity and owner listing. No aliases.
- **D16** Push authorization is a per-repo **rule language** at `repos/<o>/<r>/policy.json` (`docs/POLICY.md`).
  Envelope `version` + `groups` + `rules`; `protect` = AND. Empty/missing = anyone with write may move any ref.
- **D17** `bundles.require` refuses only **unbounded** zero-have fetches (no `deepen*`, no `filter`): that is a
  full clone and belongs to bundle-uri. Bounded zero-have fetches (CI's `--depth`/`--filter`) go to upload-pack.
  git never retries a failed bundle download and then falls back to a zero-have fetch; a principal that fetched
  the repo's `bundles/list` within the hour gets **one upload-pack full clone per 6 h** with a loud band-2
  WARNING; everyone else is refused with the truthful message.
- **D18** **History pack**: a tier-2 base is published with a derived `pack-objects --filter=blob:none` pack
  (commits + trees; `PackRef.kind = HISTORY`, `derived_from = <base>`) that every instance keeps as a real local
  pack; blob bytes are all that cross the mount / range reads. Superseded with its base.
- **D19** **The serving runtime is untouchable.** (1) control-plane store objects (manifest, log, checkpoints,
  leases, bundle list, policy, render cache) never share a transport or a permit with bulk bytes (packs, idx,
  side-files, bundles, LFS, ranged reads: their own pools under `store.gcs.bulk_concurrency`); (2) pack
  materialization never runs on the serving runtime (`sync::on_bulk_runtime`) and never queues as a writer on
  `RepoHandle::rw` — the refs phase needs only `sync_mutex`, pack removal is `try_write()` (a queued writer on a
  tokio RwLock blocks every new reader; one 24-minute clone once starved every info/refs for minutes).
- **D20** **One API, two lanes, one SDK**: `/{o}/{r}/api/…` accepts a bearer or the same-origin session;
  `/{o}/{r}/api-browser/…` is the cross-origin browser lane (`credentials: "include"`, CORS only for
  `server.cors_origins`, sign-in popup at `/api-browser/v1/authenticate`). The SDK **`repos.js`**
  (`web/sdk/repos.ts`; IIFE registers `window.repos`, ESM `repos.mjs`) maps the whole surface, picks the lane,
  does the popup dance and unwraps the SSE envelope; served at `/repos.js` (open, so a `<script>` tag can load it).
  **Dogfood rule**: the bundled UI is built on the SDK (`web/src/api.ts` is an adapter); fix the SDK, never fork.
- **D21** **No monthly bundle layer.** git's `creationToken` heuristic never walks past a full bundle; two layers
  of incrementals (daily, hourly) under one full (weekly) is the shape. Incrementals without `chain` list only
  their 2 newest per strategy (the second so a client that read the list a slot ago never 404s mid-chain);
  **`chain = true`** cuts a slot on the strategy's own previous bundle while that is newer than the newest base
  bundle — every slot since the base is wanted and kept, each exactly its delta. **Dailies are chained by
  default**; hourlies stay on the newest daily with 2 kept. `slots::base_for_incremental` is the one place that
  knows either rule.
- **D22** **Bundles are cut on calendar slots, main-only, as-of-slot, with a contiguous chain**
  (`docs/BUNDLE_URI_DESIGN.md` §3/§4): a 6-field UTC cron `schedule` whose fire time *is* the slot; missing full
  slots backfilled oldest-first (`backfill_max`); content is main as of the highest WAL seq with `created_at ≤
  slot`; `creationToken = slot epoch`; prerequisites = tips of the newest `base` bundle at or before the slot;
  retention = `keep` fulls + the chain under them; refs default to `HEAD` + `refs/heads/main` for
  `bundles.main_only` repos (+ `extra_refs`).
- **D23** **An edge is optional and load-bearing only for bytes.** An nginx in front may terminate TLS, cache one
  `auth_request` verdict per credential, route by `/<owner>/<repo>`, and offload static bytes by `X-Accel-Redirect`
  — only when it injects `X-Walgit-Capabilities: accel-redirect`; the app's answer supplies `X-Walgit-Store-Url` /
  `-Authorization` / `-Key` and the edge slices and caches. `deploy/nginx.conf.example` is the reference; nothing
  in `crates/` knows a hostname.
- **D24** **Per-repo settings live in the WAL.** `RepoSettings {toml, revision, author, updated_at, message}` — a
  TOML document restricted to `[bundles]`, `[maintenance]`, `[compaction]`, `[upstream]` (≤ 16 KiB) — is published
  as a `SETTINGS` log entry **and inline on `manifest.pb`** (every refs-level sync sees the effective config at no
  extra round trip). Effective config = host `walgit.toml` ⊕ env ⊕ settings (`Config::with_settings`). Validated at
  publish; invalid = 400, nothing published. Surface: `GET|PUT|DELETE /{o}/{r}/api/settings`, `…/effective`,
  `…/history`; `walgit repo settings show|set|clear|history`. Not in settings: auth, store, server, wal, cache,
  `upstream.token_env` (host-only). `GET …/effective` returns only those sections. PUT/DELETE of settings and of
  `policy.json` require an **admin** principal (`tokens[].admin`, or oidc `admin_emails`/`admin_domains`;
  `mode = none` is admin on loopback). Write is push, not admin.
- **D25** **Two cache modes.** `cache.mode = "budget" | "disk" | "auto"` (auto = disk when `maintenance.disk =
  "ssd"`); in **disk** mode `cache_budget_bytes()` is 0 = unlimited — every repo fully local, never the
  too-large/remote/link path, eviction only under disk pressure (`cache.disk_high_watermark`, idle-oldest first).
- **D26** **Routing is by repo prefix, nothing else.** Everything whose path starts with `/<owner>/<repo>` (git
  smart HTTP, `.git` suffix, bundles, LFS, `/{o}/{r}/api*`, `/{o}/{r}/settings`, the SPA pages) is one routing
  unit; an edge maps `^/<o>/<r>[./?]` → a host. "Which machine serves a repo" is decidable from the first path
  segments alone (the `Server` header shows it). **D27** Lanes are a segment *after* the repo prefix
  (`/api`, `/api-browser`); the prefix is still the only routing key.
- **D28** **The host that maintains a repo is its writer.** Forwarding receive-pack to a broker
  (`wal.push_broker_url` + `push_broker_token`) is for hosts that maintain nothing. A `maintain` host refuses a push
  for a repo it does not `assigned()` (band-2 line + `ng`). Publish is CAS-safe, so two writer hosts for two
  disjoint repo sets is correct by construction; the broker is an optimisation.
- **D29** **An edge's fallback for a placed repo is read-only and refs-level.** GETs (info/refs, API, UI, bundle
  list, bundles) may fall back to another host; git RPC and LFS writes have no fallback and get **503 +
  `Retry-After: 15`** — a replayed POST either hangs or warms the wrong host while the client sees nothing.
- **D30** **Placement is configured, not inferred.** `[placement] serve / serve_exclude / maintain /
  maintain_exclude` (globs). A host that does not **serve** a repo answers its object work with **503 +
  `Retry-After: 15`** and a pkt-line `ERR walgit: <repo> is served by <host>; retry shortly` *before* any sync;
  refs-level reads stay available everywhere. **maintain** gates the maintainer loop.
  Test: `host_excluded_from_serving_a_repo_refuses_object_work_with_503`.
- **D31** **Draining must not stop serving.** *Phase 1* (SIGTERM): the maintenance loop starts no new unit and
  the running unit is **interrupted at once** (D22 redoes it; a unit too expensive to redo is made resumable —
  `BaseRebuild`) while the instance serves everything normally, `/readyz` 200; bounded 30 s. *Phase 2*:
  `/readyz` 503 + Retry-After, new fetch/push/LFS refused with 503 before any work, in-flight requests get
  `server.drain_timeout`, exit. Test `tests/drain.rs`.
- **D32** **Events are produced from the WAL by one small service, never by the push path** (`docs/EVENTS.md`).
  The **events bridge** (`roles=["events"]`) tails each repo's log from a durable per-repo cursor
  (`events/cursor.json`), converts committed PUSH/REF_UPDATE entries to `ref` events, POSTs each batch to
  `events.webhook_url` (JSON array; `X-Walgit-Delivery` = sha1 of the body; `X-Walgit-Signature: sha256=<HMAC>`
  when `webhook_secret` is set), advances the cursor: published iff durable, a crash loses nothing, lag =
  `head_seq − cursor`. Writers and the WAL crate contain no event code. Wake-ups: `POST /_events/notify` from a
  bucket notification (at-least-once) + a periodic sweep as backstop. Dedup key `(repo, seq, ref_name)`.
- **D33** **A repository's refs can follow an upstream git host, through the WAL, by its maintainer.**
  `[upstream] follow = ["refs/heads/main"]` (needs `upstream.git`; `upstream.token_env` names the env var with the
  token) makes the maintaining host fetch the delta every `maintenance.follow_interval` and publish it as an
  ordinary PUSH entry (`principal = upstream`), fast-forward only; policy is not evaluated (follow is
  configuration). Its own loop, never a unit of the priority loop. `walgit mirror` is the same operation from a
  host without the repo local, pushing over HTTP.
- **D39** **walgit is a standalone program; any deployment is packaging.** `walgit-server --config x.toml` (a thin
  bin = `walgit serve`; `walgit` with no subcommand serves too) works on one machine against one bucket with
  nothing in front of it. (1) **TLS in-process** — `[server.tls] mode = off | self_signed | files`; self-signed
  certs are generated once under `<cache.dir>/tls/`, published at `/services/public/ca.pem`, pinned for git by the
  installer. (2) **Everything an upstream might take over is announced by the upstream, per request, in
  `X-Walgit-Capabilities`** — never assumed. (3) `cache.dir` defaults to `/tmp/walgit`. (4) A missing `--config`
  file is fatal (exit 2); `--config /dev/null` is the explicit defaults+env form. (5) The credential helper and
  token file are host-derived (`<host>-credential-helper`, `<host>-token`) so two walgit hosts coexist on one machine.
- **D41** **Bundles: chained dailies, a clone list and a catch-up list, the chain through the weekly.** Dailies
  are cut on their predecessor (`chain = true`, default), hourlies on the newest daily (2 kept); at the tie between
  Sunday's daily and the weekly the chain continues through its own link, so Monday's daily has the weekly's tips
  as prerequisites without being cut on it; retention keeps the chain under every kept full. `bundles/list` (fulls
  + chain) is for clones, **`bundles/catchup`** (no fulls) is what recipes record in `fetch.bundleURI`. Measured: a
  catch-up is exactly the slots missed; for a client fetching several times a day, upload-pack's thin pack is
  smaller than an hourly bundle — bundles pay off for fresh clones and far-behind clients.
- **D42** **Azure Blob Storage is a first-class ObjectStore backend** (2026-08-23), alongside S3 and GCS.
  `store.backend = "azure"`; the container is `store.bucket`. Credentials come from env — account key
  (`store.azure.account_key_env`, default `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`), connection string
  (`store.azure.connection_string_env`), or Microsoft Entra ID (`store.azure.use_aad`: AKS workload identity,
  managed identity, then developer tools). The endpoint is empty for
  `https://{account}.blob.core.windows.net`, or `http://127.0.0.1:10000` for Azurite. Version
  tokens are blob ETags (opaque, quotes stripped). Compose is Put Block From URL + Put Block List
  (`supports_compose = true`, `compose_is_native = false`); `signed_get_url` / `accel_target` mint a
  service SAS (account key) or user-delegation SAS (Entra). The Blob REST API is used directly: the
  official `azure_storage_blob` 1.x client is TokenCredential-only and cannot sign Azurite/account-key
  requests. Local bar: `just test-azure` against Azurite.

Decision identifiers are stable; gaps in the numbering are intentional.

## 5. Working rules

- **No backwards compatibility (pre-1.0, banner at top):** change the shape and delete the old one in the same
  commit — no aliases, shims, deprecated routes/keys/fields. Only bucket formats (WAL, manifest, log, checkpoint
  protos) stay append-only/replayable.
- Keep this file current: append decisions with a number and a date; never delete history, replace it with the
  decision that superseded it.
- **Never block the async runtime**: no blocking git/fs work (repack, midx, commit-graph, gix reopen, large
  reads/copies) on a tokio worker — `spawn_blocking`; every `refresh()` on an async path is `refresh_async()`. Pack
  materialization runs on the **bulk runtime** (`sync::on_bulk_runtime`). The runtime watchdog logs "async runtime
  stalled" with `inflight` and `tasks_running`: `inflight = 0` at a late tick ⇒ the platform paused the process,
  `inflight > 0` ⇒ a real stall — look at `lock_wait_max_ms` and `walgit_lock_wait_seconds{lock}`. Bulk bytes never
  share a transport with the control plane (`store.gcs.bulk_clients`, `bulk_concurrency`).
- **Correct is not sufficient.** Every protocol change (publish, sync, leases, checkpoints, bundles) is also
  judged on critical-path round trips against the bucket — read `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md`, update its budget table, put
  before/after depth in the commit, keep verification on the failure path, assert request budgets in the sim.
- **Standalone first (D39):** a feature must work with walgit hit directly (no edge, in-process TLS, bytes
  streamed by walgit). Anything an edge takes over is announced per request in `X-Walgit-Capabilities`; never
  infer an edge from config, never hardcode a hostname in `crates/` or `web/`.
- **S3, GCS and Azure Blob are all first class.** Every store feature has all three implementations and
  runs in the contract suite (`just test-s3` against rustfs, `just test-gcs <bucket>`, `just test-azure`
  against Azurite); "GCS only" (or any single-backend path) is a bug.
- **Use the rig before prod** (`just dev-store` → `walgit-server --config walgit.standalone.toml`). Per-repo
  settings (D24) with minute-scale slots compress a week of bundle behaviour into 30 minutes.
- No new auth paths (§1.3). No LIST on hot paths. No unbounded buffering of packs in memory. No full
  materialization above `cache.max_bytes` in budget mode. No silent long operations (make it a task, narrate it).
- Every immutable response: `immutable` + strong ETag + Range; every ref-dependent response: SWR + ETag.
- Before changing the wire/store formats: proto is append-only; manifests/log entries must stay replayable by
  old readers within the retention window.
- Web: pnpm + Vite, `pnpm run build` must pass oxlint/tsc. Config: `walgit.example.toml` documents every key;
  change it with the code.
- Test tiers: `just test` (fast, < 1 min), `just e2e`, `just warnings`, `just ci` = all three; the **simulation
  suite** `cargo test -p walgit-server --test sim` (fault links per instance over one truth store: crash,
  partition, stale, lost response, orphan scenarios + randomized seeds `WALGIT_SIM_SEEDS`/`WALGIT_SIM_SEED`);
  `just test-slow` (ignored benches); `tests/e2e.sh` against a running server (`WALGIT_E2E_BASE_URL`,
  `WALGIT_TOKEN`). Never `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` in a session; wrap ad-hoc cargo in `timeout`.
- Known flaky (find the cause, not the assertion): `fetch_from_front_that_serves_the_base_remotely` (~1 in 3
  under the full e2e suite: base published without `has_commit_graph`) and
  `sim::base_rebuild_resumes_after_a_kill_between_any_two_phases` (~1 in 7, shared `TEST_ABORT_AFTER`). Both
  pass alone.
